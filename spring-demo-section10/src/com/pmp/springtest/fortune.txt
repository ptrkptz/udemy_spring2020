Anxiety won't help your problems.
If you're happy, you're successful.
Help, I'm being held prisoner in a Chinese cookie factory.
You cannot become rich except by enriching others.
Sometimes the object of the journey is not the end, but the journey itself.
You will enjoy good health, you will be surrounded by luxury
Integrity is doing the right thing, even if nobody is watching.
All the preparation you've done will finally be paying off!
The cure for grief is movement.
If your desires are not extravagant, they will be granted
You will inherit a large sum of money.
Your high-minded principles spell success.
A smile is your passport into the hearts of others.
It's up to you to clearify.
You will enjoy good health, you will be surrounded by luxury
